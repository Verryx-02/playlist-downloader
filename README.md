## Spotify Configuration

### **Step 1: Create Spotify App**

1. **Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)**
2. **Login** with your Spotify account
3. **Click "Create an App"**
4. **Fill out the form:**
   - **App name:** `Playlist Downloader`
   - **App description:** `Personal music downloader`
   - **Website:** `http://localhost`
   - **Redirect URI:** `http://localhost:8080/callback`
5. **Click "Save"**
6. **Copy your Client ID and Client Secret** (you'll need these next)

### **Step 2: Configure the Project**

1. **Open the configuration file:**
   ```powershell
   notepad config\config.yaml
   ```

2. **Update Spotify credentials:**
   ```yaml
   spotify:
     client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
     client_secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
     redirect_url: "http://localhost:8080/callback"
   ```

3. **Save the file**

## üåê SSH Tunnel Setup (Required for Authentication)

**Why needed:** Spotify needs to redirect you after authorization. The SSH tunnel makes your computer temporarily reachable from the internet for this callback.

### **Method 1: localhost.run (Recommended)**

1. **In a separate terminal window, run:**
   ```powershell
   ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 nokey@localhost.run
   ```

2. **The service will give you a URL like:**
   ```
   Connect to http://abc123.lhr.life or https://abc123.lhr.life
   ```

3. **Update your configuration:**
   ```yaml
   spotify:
     redirect_url: "https://abc123.lhr.life/callback"
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Add `/callback` at the end!

4. **Update your Spotify app:**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Click your app ‚Üí "Settings"
   - In "Redirect URIs" add: `https://abc123.lhr.life/callback`
   - **Click "Save"**


## üéµ First Use

### **Step 1: Spotify Authentication**

1. **Make sure your SSH tunnel is still running**
2. **Run login command:**
   ```powershell
   playlist-dl auth login
   ```

3. **The browser will open automatically to Spotify**
4. **Click "Authorize" or "Allow"**
5. **Authentication should complete automatically**

**If you see "Enter the authorization code":**
- You're using an external tunnel
- Copy the **long code** from the redirected URL (not the Client ID)
- The code looks like: `AQBmA7j8k3L9m2N5o6P7q8R9s0T1u2V3w4X5y6Z7`

### **Step 2: System Test**

```powershell
# Check if everything works
playlist-dl doctor
```

### **Step 3: Your First Download**

1. **Find a Spotify playlist:**
   - Go to any Spotify playlist you like
   - Click "Share" ‚Üí "Copy link"

2. **Download the playlist:**
   ```powershell
   playlist-dl download "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/YOUR_LINK_HERE"
   ```

3. **Files will be saved to:**
   ```
   C:\Users\YourName\Music\Playlist Downloads\Playlist Name\
   ```
