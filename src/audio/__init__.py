Audio processing package for comprehensive audio handling and quality management

This package provides a complete audio processing pipeline for the Playlist-Downloader
application, encompassing metadata management, audio enhancement, format conversion,
and quality control operations. It serves as the central hub for all audio-related
functionality, bridging the gap between downloaded audio sources and final output files.

Package Architecture:

The audio package is organized into two primary modules that work together to provide
comprehensive audio processing capabilities:

1. **Metadata Module (metadata.py)**:
   - ID3 tag management and manipulation
   - Audio file metadata extraction and validation
   - Album artwork embedding and processing
   - Format-specific metadata handling (MP3, FLAC, M4A)
   - Metadata normalization and standardization

2. **Processor Module (processor.py)**:
   - Audio format conversion and transcoding
   - Quality analysis and enhancement
   - Audio normalization and level adjustment
   - File validation and integrity checking
   - Performance optimization for batch operations

Key Components:

**Metadata Management System:**
- `MetadataManager`: Core class for comprehensive metadata operations
- `get_metadata_manager()`: Factory function implementing singleton pattern
- Supports standard tags: title, artist, album, year, track number, genre
- Advanced features: album artwork embedding, custom tag handling
- Format compatibility: MP3 (ID3v2), FLAC (Vorbis Comments), M4A (iTunes tags)

**Audio Processing Engine:**
- `AudioProcessor`: Main processor class for audio operations
- `get_audio_processor()`: Factory function with configuration management
- `AudioAnalysis`: Detailed audio characteristics and quality metrics
- Conversion pipeline: format transcoding with quality preservation
- Enhancement suite: normalization, noise reduction, dynamic range optimization

Design Patterns:

1. **Factory Pattern**: 
   - `get_metadata_manager()` and `get_audio_processor()` provide configured instances
   - Enables dependency injection and centralized configuration
   - Supports testing with mock implementations

2. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - Shared instances across the application to prevent resource conflicts
   - Unified configuration and state management
   - Efficient resource utilization for expensive operations

3. **Strategy Pattern**:
   - Different processing strategies based on audio format and quality requirements
   - Configurable enhancement pipelines for various use cases
   - Adaptive processing based on source material characteristics

Integration Points:

**Spotify Integration:**
- Extracts metadata from Spotify track objects
- Applies comprehensive tagging using artist, album, and track information
- Embeds album artwork from Spotify's image URLs

**YouTube Music Integration:**
- Processes downloaded audio files from YouTube sources
- Applies metadata enhancement and quality normalization
- Handles format conversion from source to target formats

**Download Pipeline:**
- Seamless integration with download operations
- Parallel processing for batch metadata operations
- Quality validation and error recovery

**Configuration System:**
- Respects user preferences for audio quality and format
- Configurable enhancement settings and processing options
- Performance tuning based on system capabilities

Core Functionality:

**Metadata Operations:**
- Extract existing metadata from audio files
- Apply comprehensive tagging from Spotify metadata
- Embed high-quality album artwork
- Normalize metadata fields and encoding
- Validate metadata completeness and accuracy

**Audio Processing:**
- Convert between supported formats (MP3, FLAC, M4A)
- Analyze audio characteristics and quality metrics
- Apply quality enhancement and normalization
- Validate audio integrity and playability
- Optimize file size while preserving quality

**Quality Control:**
- Audio analysis for format validation
- Metadata completeness verification
- File integrity checking and corruption detection
- Quality metrics calculation and reporting
- Automatic quality enhancement where applicable

Performance Considerations:

**Memory Management:**
- Streaming audio processing for large files
- Efficient metadata caching and batch operations
- Resource cleanup and garbage collection optimization

**Processing Efficiency:**
- Multi-threaded processing for batch operations
- Hardware acceleration where available
- Configurable processing parameters for performance tuning

**Storage Optimization:**
- Intelligent format selection based on quality requirements
- Lossless processing chains to prevent quality degradation
- Efficient temporary file management during processing

Error Handling:

**Robust Error Recovery:**
- Graceful degradation for unsupported formats
- Fallback strategies for metadata extraction failures
- Corruption detection and recovery mechanisms
- Detailed error reporting and logging

**Validation Systems:**
- Pre-processing validation to prevent errors
- Post-processing verification of output quality
- Metadata consistency checking across operations

Thread Safety:

All components are designed for concurrent usage in multi-threaded download
operations. Shared resources are properly synchronized, and factory functions
provide thread-safe instance management.

Usage Examples:

    from audio import get_metadata_manager, get_audio_processor
    
    # Get configured manager instances
    metadata_mgr = get_metadata_manager()
    audio_proc = get_audio_processor()
    
    # Process downloaded audio file
    metadata_mgr.apply_spotify_metadata(file_path, spotify_track)
    analysis = audio_proc.analyze_audio(file_path)
    
    # Convert format if needed
    if analysis.needs_conversion:
        audio_proc.convert_format(file_path, target_format)

Dependencies:

**Required Libraries:**
- mutagen: Metadata manipulation across multiple formats
- pydub: Audio processing and format conversion
- pillow: Image processing for album artwork
- ffmpeg: Advanced audio processing backend

**Optional Enhancements:**
- librosa: Advanced audio analysis capabilities
- soundfile: High-quality audio I/O operations
- resampy: High-quality audio resampling

API Design Philosophy:

The package follows a clean, intuitive API design that abstracts complex audio
processing operations behind simple, well-documented interfaces. Factory functions
provide properly configured instances, while the main classes offer both high-level
convenience methods and low-level control for advanced use cases.
