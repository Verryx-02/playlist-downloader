Synchronization package for intelligent playlist management and incremental updates

This package provides comprehensive synchronization capabilities for the Playlist-Downloader
application, handling playlist update logic, tracklist management, and incremental updates.
It implements sophisticated algorithms for detecting changes, planning updates, and executing
synchronization operations while maintaining data integrity and optimal performance.

Architecture Overview:

The synchronization package is built around two complementary systems that work together
to provide complete playlist lifecycle management:

1. **Tracklist Management System (tracker.py)**:
   - Persistent playlist state tracking and change detection
   - Metadata management and version control for playlists
   - Track position and status monitoring across synchronization cycles
   - Historical data preservation for rollback and analysis capabilities

2. **Synchronization Engine (synchronizer.py)**:
   - Intelligent update planning and execution coordination
   - Delta-based synchronization with minimal resource usage
   - Multi-stage synchronization pipeline with error recovery
   - Progress monitoring and detailed operation reporting

Key Capabilities:

**Intelligent Change Detection:**

1. **Progressive Updates**: Execute operations in planned sequence
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Track progress and handle errors gracefully
3. **Quality Validation**: Verify successful completion of each operation
4. **State Persistence**: Update tracking data and commit changes

**Phase 4: Verification and Reporting**

    tracklist = tracker.load_tracklist(playlist_id)
    
    # Plan synchronization with remote state
    sync_plan = synchronizer.create_sync_plan(tracklist, remote_playlist)
    
    # Execute synchronization
    if sync_plan.has_changes:
        sync_result = synchronizer.execute_sync(sync_plan)
