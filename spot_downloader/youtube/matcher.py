YouTube Music matching for spot-downloader (PHASE 2).

This module handles finding the best YouTube Music match for each
Spotify track. It uses the same matching algorithm as spotDL for
consistency and accuracy.

Matching Algorithm:
    1. Search YouTube Music using ISRC (if available)
    2. If no ISRC match, search by "Artist - Title"
    3. Filter results by duration (within tolerance)
    4. Score results by title/artist similarity using rapidfuzz
    5. Prefer verified/official results over user uploads
    6. Return best match or None if no suitable match found

PHASE 2 Workflow:
    1. Get tracks without YouTube URL from Global Track Registry
    2. For each track, search YouTube Music
    3. Apply matching algorithm to find best result
    4. Store YouTube URL in database (or mark as failed)
    5. Return match statistics

Dependencies:
    - ytmusicapi: YouTube Music API client
    - rapidfuzz: Fuzzy string matching (same as spotDL)

Usage:
    from spot_downloader.youtube.matcher import YouTubeMatcher
    
    matcher = YouTubeMatcher(database)
    results = matcher.match_tracks(tracks, num_threads=4)
    
    # results contains MatchResult for each track
    matched = [r for r in results if r.matched]
    failed = [r for r in results if not r.matched]

class YouTubeMatcher:

    Matches Spotify tracks to YouTube Music videos/songs.
    
    This class implements PHASE 2 of the download workflow. It takes
    Track objects from PHASE 1 and finds the corresponding YouTube
    Music URL for each.
    
    Attributes:
        _database: Database instance for storing match results.
        _ytmusic: ytmusicapi YTMusic client instance.
    
    Thread Safety:
        The match_track() method is thread-safe and can be called
        from multiple threads simultaneously. The ytmusicapi client
        is stateless for search operations, and database operations
        use internal locking.
    
    Matching Strategy:
        1. ISRC Search (highest accuracy):
           If track has ISRC code, search YouTube Music using it.
           ISRC matches are very reliable.
        
        2. Text Search (fallback):
           Search using "Artist - Title" query.
           Score results using fuzzy string matching.
        
        3. Duration Filter:
           Reject results with duration difference > DURATION_TOLERANCE.
        
        4. Verification Preference:
           Prefer "songs" (verified/official) over "videos" (user uploads).
