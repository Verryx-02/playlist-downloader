"""
Logging configuration for spot-downloader.

This module sets up the logging system with multiple outputs:
    - Console: Real-time progress with tqdm-compatible formatting
    - log_full.log: Complete log of all events (DEBUG and above)
    - log_errors.log: Only ERROR and CRITICAL level messages
    - download_failures.log: Failed download track names with Spotify URLs
    - lyrics_failures.log: Tracks where lyrics were not found

The logging system follows the principle: everything to screen is also saved
to file, then filtered into specialized files.

Log File Locations:
    All log files are created in the output directory specified in config.yaml.
    Files are overwritten on each run (no rotation).

Usage:
    from spot_downloader.core.logger import setup_logging, get_logger
    
    setup_logging(output_dir)  # Call once at startup
    logger = get_logger(__name__)  # Get logger for each module
    
    logger.info("Starting download")
    logger.error("Download failed", extra={'track': 'Song Name', 'url': 'spotify:...'})
