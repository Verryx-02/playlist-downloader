File management for spot-downloader.

This module handles the file storage architecture with a central tracks/
directory and hard links in playlist directories.

            └── 00002-Bohemian Rhapsody-Queen.m4a → ../../tracks/Bohemian Rhapsody-Queen.m4a

File Naming:
    - Canonical (in tracks/): {title}-{artist}.m4a
    - Playlist links: {position:05d}-{title}-{artist}.m4a
    
    Position uses 5-digit padding (00001-99999) to support Spotify's
    maximum of 10,000 tracks per playlist.

Hard Links vs Symlinks:
    - Hard links are preferred (same inode, no storage duplication)
    - Symlinks used as fallback for cross-filesystem scenarios

Usage:
    from spot_downloader.core.file_manager import FileManager
    
    fm = FileManager(output_dir)
    
    # Get canonical path for download
    canonical = fm.get_canonical_path("Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody")
    # Returns: tracks/Bohemian Rhapsody-Queen.m4a
    
    # After download, create links in all playlists
    fm.create_playlist_link(canonical, "My Playlist", 1, "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen")
